# Subtitle-File-Filter
This script lets you select one or more folders and automatically deletes all .vtt files that do not have the word "English" in their filename, keeping only the English subtitle files. You can swap easily swap out the extension type or they keyword (i.e 'English' in this case) to use it as a general purpose filter.
